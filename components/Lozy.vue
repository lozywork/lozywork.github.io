      Lozy is the creative identity I work under.
      It connects my different projects - <i>ZoLo Cinematics</i> in film and <i>Prodby.Sassey</i> in music - into one shared vision:
      A space where creative ideas can grow and flourish freely.

      In the future, I aim to increasingly merge these two fields - for example, by creating films with original scores composed by myself. At the same time, I also want to continue developing standalone projects in both areas.
      Lozy gives me the creative framework and flexibility to do both. It's not just a name - it's my way of setting creativity in motion and sharing it with others.
