      Visual storytelling is more than just technique for me - it's my way of expressing narratives.Right now, my focus lies in video editing, where I work with a strong sense of timing, rhythm, and emotion. I explore this craft through small-scale projects where I sometimes write scripts myself or handle the filming. I don't (yet) have professional gear or a big team - but I do have plenty of ideas and a lot of passion.<br><br>
      ZoLo Cinematics is my label for everything related to film and editing. In the long run, my goal is to build a deep and well-rounded understanding of all aspects of filmmaking- from concept development and screenwriting to cinematography, directing, lighting, editing, and post-production. I want to understand how all these areas interact so I can think of films in a holistic way and contribute creatively throughout the entire process.
      Collaboration is especially important to me - I enjoy working in teams and believe that great projects emerge when diverse ideas, skills, and perspectives come together.

        Below, you'll find an example of a promotional video I produced - created in collaboration with snv_prodd.
        The main focus of this project was on editing, where I shaped the visual story through timing, rhythm, and emotion in post-production.

      Up next, you'll find a button linking to my graduation project, created as part of my Matura graduation.<br>
      It was the first project where I handled the entire production process independently - from initial idea and script to camera work, lighting, editing, and post-production.<br>
      Before starting, I took time to deeply explore each of these steps, making it a key milestone in my development as a filmmaker.
